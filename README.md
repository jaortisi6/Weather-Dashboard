# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This dashboard was created using the Open Weather Map API. A user can input a city name, and when they click the search button, the city name, current date, weather icon, and the current weather, including temperature, humidity, and windspeed are displayed. A 5-day forecast for that city is also displayed, including date, weather icon, temperature and humidity. The user's previous searches are kept in the local storage so they will appear even after a refresh or reload of the page.
